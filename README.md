# python-DFFT
A python program that calculates Discrete Fast Fourier Transform, mean, median and standard deviation from a given file.

## Running
To run the program, run the command `python main.py` from a terminal at the project's root
## Config

- `inputfile` - Specifies file from which to get sequence of values for input overridden by environment variable `INPUTFILE`
- `inputSampleRate` - Sample rate of input sequence overridden by environment variable `INPUT_SAMPLE_RATE`
- `inputBytesPerValue` - Bytes value for input values overridden by environment variable `INPUT_BYTES_PER_VALUE`
- `outputsettings` - File to save transformed sequence overriden by environment variable `OUTPUTFILE`
